# To do list application

This project was created to learn more about React. It's one more take on a simple to do list, which helped me to consolidate the knowledge I already have about React :)

## What you can do here?

The app consist of a form, where you can name your new todo task, assign to it one of the four tags and set a date to do it. I managed to add modal errors which are dynamic and prevent you from entering empty/wrong data. You also cannot choose the day any older than today. I also created a kind of placeholder to a select section of tags.
Moreover under the form we have a section where all of our "todos" are displayed, each one you can either delete or tag as "done". If you do so, it will be either removed from the list of all todos, or transfered to the "Finished task" section. You can also filter all the task by its tags. In this project I used styled components for all my styling :)

### `npm start`
